# Medical-Image-Classification-for-Disease-Detection
This project would create models to classify medical images for detecting specific conditions like pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy, or skin cancer.

Key Components:

Image preprocessing including normalization, augmentation, and resizing
Feature extraction using traditional computer vision techniques
Implementation of CNN architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet)
Transfer learning approach using pre-trained models
Performance evaluation using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity
Discussion of model interpretability for medical applications
Regulatory and privacy considerations for healthcare AI
